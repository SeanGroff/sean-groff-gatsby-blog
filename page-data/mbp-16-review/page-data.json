Apple has been known to throttle the CPU and GPU to balance the thermals and fan noise. The only drawback to the extra beef is the laptop is slightly thicker than the previous model.

My eyes aren\\u2019t the greatest so I love the extra screen real estate, even if it\\u2019s only slightly larger. One thing I\\u2019ve never cared about with laptops is the built-in speakers. It\\u2019s not that I don\\u2019t care about good audio. It\\u2019s that speakers on every laptop I\\u2019ve tried have always been bad.
