### The Bug Hunt 🐛 🏹

I recently had to fix a bug that made it to Production at work.

> Uncaught Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly
> calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of
> nested updates to prevent infinite loops.

The error itself is a little misleading. Our app doesn't use either lifecycle method anywhere in the app.
After debugging the app in my local dev environment I was led to a file that had a handful of `useEffect`s.
I hone in on `useEffect`s whenever I'm chasing down infinite loops.

```javascript
// actual code and logic removed for the sake of brevity
let [fooBar, setFooBar] = useState({ foo: null, bar: null })

useEffect(() => {
  if (baz) {
    setFooBar({ ...fooBar, bar: 123 })
  }
}, [baz, fooBar])
```

Can you spot the infinite loop?

### The Trap Explained 💣

When reading a `useEffect` I recommend reading the dependency array first.

> If the value of `baz` or `fooBar` changes, the callback inside the `useEffect` will execute

Let's focus on the `setFooBar` function. We are updating the state with an object literal, spreading the previous state, and updating the `bar` property value to `123`.
The previous state is `fooBar`. In the `useEffect` dependency array we see `fooBar` listed as a dependency.

If the value of `fooBar` changes, execute the `useEffect` callback. Set `fooBar` to `{...fooBar, bar: 123}`. This changes the value of `fooBar` so the `useEffect` callback will execute again.

There is an infinite loop.

### Solution 1 - Dispatch function update 🙋

The [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) `useState` hook returns an array of two items. The current `state` and a function that updates it.
Unbeknownst to many, this function accepts a callback function providing you access to the previous `state`.
This "previous state" is guaranteed to be the latest state, unlike relying on a closure. [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) has a great article explaining the `useState` dispatch function update [here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-state-lazy-initialization-and-function-updates#dispatch-function-updates).

Let's update our `useEffect` code to utilize the function update instead.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (baz) {
    setFooBar((prevState) => ({ ...prevState, bar: 123 }))
  }
}, [baz])
```

Now, the `useEffect` no longer depends on the `fooBar` value change to execute, solving our infinite loop issue!

### Solution 2 - useReducer 🧙‍♂️

I don't want `useReducer` to hijack the main topic of this blog post but it is a viable solution.

```javascript
let fooBarReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    'UPDATE_BAR':
      return {...state, bar: action.bar}
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid Action Type')
  }
}
let [state, dispatch] = useReducer(fooBarReducer, { foo: null, bar: null })

useEffect(() => {
  if (baz) {
    dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_BAR', bar: 123})
  }
}, [baz, dispatch])
```

Our `useEffect` has no dependency on the `state` we are updating which also solves our infinite loop issue.

### Conclusion 🧑‍🏫

A safe `useState` rule to follow when updating state based on the previous state, is to always use the function update pattern.
Keep an eye out for this type of bug when reviewing code that contains a `useEffect`.

Thanks for reading 💙
