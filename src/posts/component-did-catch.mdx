## What are Error Boundaries?

"Error boundaries are React components that **catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI** instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them." -[**Dan Abramov**][2]

In React, you create an error boundary with a lifecycle method called `componentDidCatch`.

```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // Catch errors in any child components
  }
}
```

## componentDidCatch Lifecycle Method

The first method parameter is the actual error thrown. The second parameter is an object with a `componentStack` property containing the component stack trace information. The `componentDidCatch()` lifecycle method works similar to JavaScript's `catch {}` but for components. An Error Boundary cannot catch an error within itself. The error will propagate to the closest Error Boundary above it. Sound familiar?

_hint: JavaScript `catch {}`_ block.

## Why do I need componentDidCatch?

Prior to React 16 Error Boundaries, errors inside components would cause unrecoverable cryptic errors. There was not a great way to handle these errors within the components.

React 16 Error Boundaries to the rescue!

## How do I use Error Boundaries?

Check out the CodeSandbox Error Boundaries example below. I'd highly recommend forking the sandbox and adding more Error Boundaries and components to see them in action.

## Benefits

Declarative vs Imperative. One of the beauties of React is it's Declarative code style. A component itself declares what should be rendered. Error Boundaries follow the Declarative nature of React. You no longer need to resort to imperative code solutions such as `try/catch` or `if/else` for conditional rendering of a UI based on errors.

Expected Behavior. Error Boundaries will propagate an error to the closest Error Boundary regardless how deep in the tree the error occurs.

Reusability. You can write one Error Boundary Component and re-use it throughout your app.

Component All The Things

## When should I use Error Boundaries?

"In practice, most of the time you'll want to declare an error boundary component once and use it throughout your application." -[**Dan Abramov**][2]

You can wrap top level route components, you might also wrap components that might contain obscure code. Its up to you how to best handle protecting against application crashes.

Once React 16 is released more standards and best practices with Error Boundaries will appear. Error Boundaries will encourage JavaScript error reporting services that can be triggered within the `componentDidCatch()` lifecycle method in Production environments.
