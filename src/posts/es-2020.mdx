## Introduction

I avoid a majority of JavaScripts pitfalls by following established best practices. Some parts of JavaScript I have no use for personally or professionally.
This leaves my toolbelt with only "The Good Parts" of JavaScript. This is mostly subjective but I follow the basic rules of functional programming, well known established best patters, and most importantly code readability.
With all of this in mind, I don't throw all the shiny brand new toys in my toolbelt. This post is going to go over the new features from the latest version of JavaScript I'll be using immediately.

## Optional Chaining

The optional chaining syntax `?.` allows you to safely access deeply nested object properties whether the property exists or not. If the object property does not exist, undefined will be returned.

### Problem

```javascript
let mammals = {
  cat: { legs: 4, tail: true, carnivore: true },
  dog: { legs: 4, tail: true, carnivore: true, petFriendly: true },
}

function getGoatLegsCount() {
  let count = mammals.goat.legs
  return count || 'Unknown'
}

let goatLegsCount = getGoatLegsCount() // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'legs' of undefined
```

### Solution before Optional Chaining

```javascript
let mammals = {
  cat: { legs: 4, tail: true, carnivore: true },
  dog: { legs: 4, tail: true, carnivore: true, petFriendly: true },
}

function getGoatLegsCount() {
  let count = mammals && mammals.goat && mammals.goat.legs // üò∞
  return count || 'Unknown'
}

let goatLegsCount = getGoatLegsCount() // 'Unknown'
```

### Solution with Optional Chaining

```javascript
let mammals = {
  cat: { legs: 4, tail: true, carnivore: true },
  dog: { legs: 4, tail: true, carnivore: true, petFriendly: true },
}

function getGoatLegsCount() {
  let count = mammals.goat?.legs // üî•
  return count || 'Unknown'
}

let goatLegsCount = getGoatLegsCount() // 'Unknown'
```

### Notes

Optional chaining also works on function calls and arrays but I don't prefer optional chaining for these currently.
Here's an example of optional chaining on a function call directly from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining).

```javascript
// Written as of ES2019
function doSomething(onContent, onError) {
  try {
    // ... do something with the data
  } catch (err) {
    if (onError) {
      // Testing if onError really exists
      onError(err.message)
    }
  }
}
// Using optional chaining with function calls
function doSomething(onContent, onError) {
  try {
    // ... do something with the data
  } catch (err) {
    onError?.(err.message) // no exception if onError is undefined
  }
}
```

In this scenario, I prefer the `if` statement but as Optional Chaining becomes more widely used that may change.

## Nullish Coalescing Operator

The nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a short syntax that returns the left-hand side operand if the operand is _defined_ (NOT `null` or `undefined`), otherwise, the right-hand side operand is returned.
If you're familiar with the logical or `||` operator you're probably asking yourself what the point of this new silly named operator is? Notice I used the word _defined_? This is different than a _falsy_ value.

### Problem

A common bug I'm certainly guilty of writing is using the `||` operator to account for _falsy_ values but forgetting to handle the number `0` which is a _falsy_ value.

### Solution before Nullish Coalescing

```javascript
let nothing = null
let zero = 0
let five = 5

function getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(number) {
  return number || 9000
}

getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(nothing) // 9000 ‚úÖ
getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(zero) // 9000 üêõ
getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(five) // 5 ‚úÖ
```

### Solution with Nullish Coalescing

```javascript
let nothing = null
let zero = 0
let five = 5

function getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(number) {
  return number ?? 9000
}

getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(nothing) // 9000 ‚úÖ
getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(zero) // 0 ‚úÖ
getSuperSaiyanPowerLevel(five) // 5 ‚úÖ
```

### Notes

The precedence of the `??` operator is pretty low so I add parenthesis whenever I'm writing a complex expression. As a safety feature JavaScript prevents you from using `??` together with `&&` and `||` operators.

```javascript
let foo = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error‚õîÔ∏è
```

To get around this you can add parenthesis to the expressions

```javascript
let foo = (1 && 2) ?? 3 // 2 ‚úÖ
```

I think mixing `??`, `&&`, `||` is a code smell but I'm not your boss!

## Conclusion

As a mostly frontend engineer, I don't plan on using the remainder of the new ES2020 features very often. Except for `Promise.allSettled()` which I may be able to utilize in React to hide loading spinners that should disappear when a series of promises resolves ü§î.

Thanks for reading!
